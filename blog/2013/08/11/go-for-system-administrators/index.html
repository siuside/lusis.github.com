<!-- more -->


<p>This is something I said the other day. I figured it deserved a more detailed blog post.</p>

<h2>NKOTB</h2>

<p>Most people who know me professionally know two things about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m fairly pragmatic and somewhat conservative about technology decisions</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a language tourist</li>
</ul>


<p>This second one is something Bryan Berry attributed to me in an early FoodFight episode. What&#8217;s interesting is the two things seemingly conflict.</p>

<p>I love learning new programming languages. This comes as a pretty big shock to me on a regular basis because I&#8217;m not a professional programmer. I didn&#8217;t go to college for programming (I actually didn&#8217;t go to college at all). My career in IT has been pretty much 100% focused on the area of operations. Anything I&#8217;ve ever touched - qa, dba, dev - has always been from that lens and to satisfy some need operationally.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s weird that I find myself 18 years later having a working knowledge of ruby, python, perl, java and a few other languages to a lesser degree. Mainly I come to new languages to scratch an itch.</p>

<p>This leads me to picking up Go.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of Go, there are countless articles, blog posts and a shitload of new tooling written in it. The latest batch of hotness around linux containers and new deployment models (docker) is based on Go. There are also quite a few other &#8220;big&#8221; name projects built in Go as well - packer, etcd. Mozilla is doing all new internal tooling in Go (as I understand it) and quite a few folks are switching to it.</p>

<p>Mind you I don&#8217;t pick up languages based on popularity. I don&#8217;t care for JavaScript and Node at all, for instance. Originally I had no interest in Go either. I figured it was another Google experiment that was more academic than anything else. Besides, if I had to get a handle on a c-like language, why not just learn C and be done with it?</p>

<p>I actually attempted that route working on a PAM module for StormPath. While it was somewhat satisfying, it was ultimately VERY frustrating.</p>

<h2>So why Go now?</h2>

<p>One of the reasons I decided to give Go another shot was that it appeared to be around for the long haul after all. That made at least a contender for me.
But then some of the tooling I was using operationally was being built in Go. Since I wanted to be able to fix issues in those tools (especially considering they were new projects which would surely need fixes) I really needed to pick up on the language.</p>

<p>However one tool really pushed me that last step - <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a>.</p>

<p>You can read up on etcd yourself but if you know my history with <a href="https://github.com/lusis/Noah">Noah</a>, you realize WHY I have such an interest in this.</p>

<p>What surprised me was when I decided that I&#8217;d probably be writing a lot of tooling myself in Go.</p>

<h2>On Pragmatism</h2>

<p>All the internal tooling my team develops at Dell Enstratius is written in Python. This was a pragmatic choice for us:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s the least common denominator on platforms our product supports (So it will always be on customer systems)</li>
<li>It&#8217;s rigid in the right ways for new programmers (of which we had quite a few on our team)</li>
<li>Regardless of skill level with Python, you can usually look at someone else&#8217;s code and follow it thanks to the previous item</li>
</ul>


<p>Why didn&#8217;t we go with Ruby considering I was personally much stronger at Ruby and we had some Ruby experience via Chef internally?</p>

<ul>
<li>Have you seen the state of Ruby on distros?</li>
<li>We didn&#8217;t want to conflict with any possible customer tooling using Ruby</li>
<li>Not enough rigidity for the new folks</li>
<li>As comfortable as I am at Ruby, because of the flexibility of the language and metaprogramming, it can be downright impossible to navigate someone else&#8217;s code</li>
</ul>


<p>Our team weighed all the options here and we all agreed on Python. I set out to write a library for accessing our API. This would give us a foundation for our tooling as well as serve as a reference project - with tests, project structure, bin scripts and the like - for new tooling.</p>

<p>Things are/were going great up until a recent situation with a customer. We try and minimize dependencies in our tooling for obvious reasons. However there are a few libraries that just make things SO much easier - <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests">requests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy">envoy</a>. We also like to use <a href="http://fabfile.org">Fabric</a> to wrap some things up.</p>

<p>However we ran into a situation where a customer refused to let us pull packages in externally. So while we could &#8220;sneakernet&#8221; the bulk of our tools over, some things wouldn&#8217;t work. Tracking down all the transitive deps and vendoring everything was a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>This is what lead to my statement above.</p>

<h2>Tooling in Go</h2>

<p>Go, while not as tight a feedback loop as Python, is still pretty tight. Compilations happen fast and you can test fairly quickly. But the dependency issue is really the killer. It simply doesn&#8217;t exist. I can take that binary I compiled and move it around with no problem without needing the runtime installed. There are lots of batteries included in the stdlib as well.</p>

<p>I can also compile that same code on osx, windows or linux with no modification. This bit us in Python with some of our deps as well.</p>

<p>As I said, while the tooling I&#8217;m currently writing has no need for any of the advanced concurrency stuff in go, it&#8217;s nice that&#8217;s it there out of the box should I want to use it.</p>

<h2>This isn&#8217;t a switching story</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re not switching to Go for our tooling but I probably will. I&#8217;m already working on writing a wrapper for our API in Go so I can duplicate some of the tools. This will be really handy when I&#8217;m on a system where dependencies are limited. That&#8217;s really what this post is about.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in operations, there is no reason you shouldn&#8217;t learn Go.</p>

<p>The syntax is easy. The stuff that made C painful is largely hidden from you. Meanwhile you don&#8217;t need to worry about what version of Python or Ruby is installed on your systems. It&#8217;s a great language to use for bootstrap tools where you don&#8217;t yet have your deps installed. It&#8217;ll also help should you start adopting tools like docker, packer or etcd.</p>

<p>Give it a shot.</p>
