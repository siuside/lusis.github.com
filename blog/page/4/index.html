  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is part 2 in a post on deployment strategies. The previous post is located <a href="http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2011/10/18/rollbacks-and-other-deployment-myths/">here</a></em></p>

<p>My previous post covered some of the annoying excuses and complaints that people like to use when discussing deployments. The big take away should have been the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The risk associated with deploying new code is not in the deploy itself but everything you did up to that point.</li>
<li>The way to make deploying new code less risky is to do it more often, not less.</li>
<li>Create a culture and environment that enables and encourages small, frequent releases.</li>
<li>Everything fails. Embrace failure.</li>
<li>Make deploys trivial, automated and tolerant of failure.</li>
</ul>


<p>I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I&#8217;ve said this several times before. You can get 90% of the way to a fully automated environment, never go that last 10% and still be better off than you were before. I understand that people have regulations, requirements and other things that prevent a fully automated system. You don&#8217;t ever have to flip that switch but you should strive to get as close as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across an interesting post today via HN. I&#8217;m surprised (only moderately) that I missed it the first time around since this is right up my alley:</p>

<p><a href="http://briancrescimanno.com/2011/09/29/why-are-you-still-deploying-overnight/">Why are you still deploying overnight?</a></p>

<p>I thought this post was particularly apropos for several reasons. I just got back from DevOpsDays EU <strong>AND</strong> I&#8217;m currently in the process of refactoring our deploy process.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m breaking this up into two parts since it&#8217;s a big topic. The first one will cover the more &#8220;theoretical&#8221; aspects of the issue while the second will provide more concrete information.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>wherein John admits he was wrong about something</em></p>

<p>As I was checking my Github feed tonight (as I&#8217;ve been known to do on occassion), I saw an update for a project that I was watching. This project is, for all intents and purposes, a redo of Capistrano with some additional system management stuff on top. From the description:</p>

<blockquote><p>All together mixed to make your life easier.
As mentioned before do is a fun mix of capistrano, rake, thor and brew.
With XXXXX you are be able to do easily common task on your local or remote machine. The aim of XXXXX is to become the unique and universal tool language that permit you to make your own brew, apt-get or yum package, same syntax for all your machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now I&#8217;ve said before I&#8217;m a tool junkie. I&#8217;m always looking for ideas and inspiration from other tools. I also love to contribute where I can.
What bothered me particularly about this project is that it felt like a &#8220;solved problem&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many, many years ago I started blogging. It&#8217;s fun and I like to feel self-important by dumping my ideas. I enjoy writing so blogging is cool like that.</p>

<p>Over the past 12 years I&#8217;ve gone through various tools to help me do that (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>PHPnuke</li>
<li>Postnuke</li>
<li>Moveable Type</li>
<li>Plone</li>
<li>CakePHP</li>
<li>rst2html vim plugin</li>
<li>Blogger</li>
<li>Wordpress</li>
<li>Homegrown shit</li>
</ul>


<p>With the exception of one, all of these tools were simply a pain in the ass. They required lots of moving pieces, we&#8217;re bug ridden and security nightmares.
The one tool I enjoyed the most?</p>

<p>rst2html in Vim</p>

<p>The only reason I used those tools was because I hated writing HTML. I hated dealing with styling. About 3 years ago I finally settled on using Blogger. Now I&#8217;m changing again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>warning! This is a really long post</em></p>

<p>In the course of rewriting the <a href="https://github.com/lusis/Noah">Noah</a> callback daemon, I started to get really frustrated with EventMachine. This is nothing against EventMachine by any stretch of the imagination. I really like it.</p>

<p>What I was having issues with is making the plugin framework as dirt simple as possible. By using EM, I had no choice but to require folks to understand how EM works. This primarily meant not blocking the reactor. Additionally, through no fault of EM, I was starting to get mired in callback spaghetti.</p>

<h1>Actors</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned several times before that I love the actor model. It makes sense to me. The idea of mailboxes and message passing is really simple to understand. For a while, there was project that implemented actors on top of EM called Revactor but it stalled. I started following the author (Tony Arcieri) on GitHub to see if he would ever update it. He did not but I caught wind of his new project and it was pretty much exactly what I was looking for.</p>

<p>Actors have a proven track record in Erlang and the Akka framework for Scala and Java uses them as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>The following post is a recap of what was discussed in the 07/21/11 #monitoringsucks irc meeting</em></p>

<p>Before I get any further, I just want to thank everyone who attended,
either in virtual person or in spirit. There have been so many awesome
discussions going around this topic since we started. I am truly
priviledged to interact with each and every one of you. I struggle to
count myself a peer and I can only hope that I provide something in
return.</p>

<p>I mentioned to someone today that I’m literally sick of the current
landscape. I consider the current crop of monitoring solutions to be
technologically bankrupt. The situation is fairly untenable at this
point.</p>

<p>I just installed (after having a total loss of an existing Zenoss setup)
Nagios again. I’m not joking when I say that it depressed the everliving
hell out of me. The monitoring landscape simply has not kept up with
modern developments. At first it was mildly frustrating. Then it was
annoying. Now it’s actually a detriment.</p>

<p>Now that we have that out of the way….</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(and what we&#8217;re doing about it)</em></p>

<p>About two weeks ago someone made a tweet. At this point, I don&#8217;t
remember who said it but the gist was that &#8220;monitoring sucks&#8221;. I
happened to be knee-deep in frustrating bullshit around that topic and
was currently evaluating the same effing tools I&#8217;d evaluated at every
other company over the past 10 years or so. So I did what seems to be
S.O.P for me these days. I started something.</p>

<p>In Part 1 and 2 of this series I covered background on Zookeeper and
discussed the similarities and differences between it and Noah. Part 3
was about the components underneath Noah that make it tick.</p>

<p>This post is about the &#8220;future&#8221; of Noah. Since I&#8217;m a fan of Fourcast
podcast, I thought it would be nice to do an immediate, medium and long
term set of goals.</p>

<p>In Part 1 and 2 of this series I covered background on Zookeeper and
discussed the similarities and differences between it and Noah. This
post is discussing the technology stack under Noah and the reasoning for
it.</p>

<h1>A little back story</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve told a few people this but my original intention was to use Noah as
a way to learn Erlang. However this did not work out. I needed to get a
proof of concept out much quicker than the ramp up time it would take to
<a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/">learn me some Erlang</a>. I had this
grandiose idea to slap mnesia, riak_core and webmachine into a tasty
ball of Zookeeper clonage.</p>

<p>In part one of this series, I went over a little background about
ZooKeeper and how the basic Zookeeper concepts are implemented in Noah.
In this post, I want to go over a little bit about a few things that
Noah does differently.</p>
