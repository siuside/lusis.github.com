    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've noticed an annoying trend recently. I was content to ignore it for a while but now it's getting almost stupid. That trend is the job title of "DevOps".</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I came across an article tonight that confused the hell out of me. It was an interview. The outlet wasn't a technical one per se but it was a technical interview none the less.</p>

<p>This part is what confused me (<em>highlights mine</em>):</p>

<p><blockquote><p>To do this requires a well-integrated platform that is full of capabilities for the <strong>developer</strong>; contemplates the needs of <strong>DevOps</strong>; provides command, control and visibility for <strong>operations</strong>; and is ....</p></blockquote></p>

<p>To quote an internet-famous person:</p>

<p><strong>WAT</strong></p>

<h2>Stepping back</h2>

<p>I don't like the idea of <em>devops</em> as a job title in the first place. I don't like it as a role either. It makes no sense. You don't call someone an <em>agile</em> so why would you call them a <em>devop</em>?</p>

<p>My problem lies in the fact that it implies that there's something wrong with being a sysadmin, operations person, developer or whatnot. Not only that but the idea behind devops is the elimination of silos, not the creation of new ones.</p>

<p>I have, however, made a bit of peace with the fact that <em>devops</em> has become a replacement title of sorts for <em>sysadmin</em> or <em>developer</em>.</p>

<p>I get the problem domain. Companies want to be able to qualify the types of people they want. The phrase <em>devops</em> carries a certain meaning with it. People are trying to leverage that. In other cases, it's become a codeword for "generalist" or "technologist". And, yes, even in some cases it's become a code word for "doing both development and ops work"</p>

<h2>What does devops mean though</h2>

<p>Here's the secret. I'll tell you EXACTLY what devops means.</p>

<p>Devops means giving a shit about your job enough to not pass the buck. Devops means giving a shit about your job enough to want to learn all the parts and not just your little world.</p>

<p>Developers need to understand infrastructure. Operations people need to understand code. People need to fucking work with each other and not just occupy space next to each other.</p>

<p>I worked at a company several years ago. We created a dedicated devops team. The rationale was solid - the company had a monolithic idea of roles and titles. We also had a large group on both sides that were only interested in doing their little bit and going home. By creating this title/team, it was easier at a company level to justify them working on non-standard projects.</p>

<p>So a "devops" team was created. This was a small team of what essentially boiled down to "super sysadmins". We wrote puppet manifests, worked with the developers to automate build processes...shit like that.</p>

<p>What ended up happening was that the devops team was seen as elitist by the operations team, nosy and invasive by the developers and everyone just passed the blame on to them - "Devops did that. Not us"</p>

<h2>So back to that quote</h2>

<p>Having said all that, what about the quote?</p>

<p>This is indicative of the problem I described above. I think I've finally figured out the question I want to ask people who think this way:</p>

<p>If devops is a distinct role/title apart from development and operations, then what the fuck does a "devop" do?</p>

<p>Let's look at that quote again. It implies that:</p>

<ul>
<li>"command, control and visibility" is something developers have no need for</li>
<li>operations won't need the same capabilities as developers</li>
<li>There's a third group that has an entirely different set of needs</li>
</ul>


<p>What is that third group? What possible aspect outside of development and operations of the IT needs of a company do those two groups not think affects them in some way and thus have a vested interest in being involved? <em>(Yes I'm aware companies have dbas, security and what not - those are shitty silos too)</em></p>

<p>This topic comes up all the time on various mailing lists and it never seems to really reach any sort of consensus. So I'm asking you. If a "devops" is something different than someone in operations or development, someone different than a sysadmin or developer....</p>

<p>What the fuck is it?</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This post was writting on an airplane with an annoying passenger in front of me, quite a bit of rum in me and a lack of sleep. I'm guessing it really doesn't look any different than any other post though does it?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I saw a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kohsukekawa/status/180717301795008512">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> that really got me frustrated.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I've addressed this topic a bit before <a href="http://lusislog.blogspot.com/2010/09/distributions-and-dynamic-languages.html">here</a>. At the time it was addressing specifically dynamic languages. However the post that Kohsuke wrote (and the post that inspired it) have led me to a new line attitude.</p>

<p><strong>Don't bother trying to get your packages into upstream vendor distros</strong></p>

<h1>Wait. What? Let's step back a sec</h1>

<p>Let me clarify something first. System packages are a good thing. The hassle has always been with BUILDING those packages. It was simply easier to build the software on the machine and install to <code>/usr/local/</code> than to try and express anything more than the most moderately simple application in RPM or DEB build scripts:</p>

<ul>
<li>If what you are packaging has dependencies not shipped with the OS, now you've got to package those</li>
<li>If your dependency conflicts with a vendor-shipped version, you're screwed.</li>
<li>If your dependency is a language runtime, give up.</li>
<li>If your dependency is a specific version of python, just go into another line of work.</li>
<li>If it's a distro LTS release, just don't bother</li>
</ul>


<h1>Ahh but we can work around this!</h1>

<p>Yes, you're right. We now have tools like <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm">fpm</a> that take the pain out of it! Maven has had plugins that generate rpms and debs for you for a while now. Things are looking up! Let's just use those tools.</p>

<p>So now you think, I'll just get these things submitted to Debian....</p>

<p><strong>KABLOCK</strong></p>

<p>I could rant a bit about Debian's packaging policy but it's addressed in the posts above. So maybe the Fedora people are more flexible?</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/px5ug.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p><strong>WAT</strong></p>

<p>So here we have the two major distros that won't even consider your package unless you give the end-user the "freedom" to make your application unusable. Essentially you are told if you want your package to be included in upstream then you have to make sure they can swap out <code>libfunkytown.so.23</code> with <code>libfunkytown.so.1</code>.</p>

<p>But maybe your application doesn't work on that version. So maybe you think, I'll just vendor ALL the things and shove it into <code>/opt</code> or <code>/usr/local</code>? Yeah that doesn't fly either (for various reasons).</p>

<p>The point is that you'll probably never be able to get your package included upstream because you'll never be able to jump through the hoops to do it.</p>

<h1>So stop trying</h1>

<p>I know, I know. It would be awesome if you could tell users to just <code>yum install kickass</code> or <code>apt-get install kickass</code> but it's not worth it for several reasons as enumerated above.</p>

<p>Distributions are not your friend. One could argue that its not thier job to be your friend. I would even agree with that argument. The distros have (or at least SHOULD have) an allegience to their user base. My argument is that position is directly opposed to your needs as a software provider.</p>

<h2>Things you should not do</h2>

<ul>
<li>Waste your time trying to ensure that your software works on some busted as old version of libfunkytown that won't get upgrade for 7 years.</li>
<li>Waste your time breaking your application into 436 interdependent subpackages just to please upstream</li>
<li>Ignore the prexisting dependency management ecosystem of your language of choice (especially if it works)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Things you should do</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use your language's preexisting dependency management system to collect all your dependencies</li>
<li>Rebar, bundle, virtualenv, mavenize, fatjar whatever ALL the dependencies</li>
<li>Use FPM or some homegrown script to create a monolithic rpm or deb of your codebase that installs to <code>/opt/appname</code></li>
<li>Make these packages available to your users on your download site</li>
<li>Alternately, create a repo and repo config file they can use to stay up to date</li>
</ul>


<p>You will be happy. Your users will be happy. The distros can go lick themselves. We have reached something of a crossroads. As I argued in the previous post, the concept of a distribution is becoming somewhat irrelevant. Distros are more concerned about politics and making statements and broken concepts like software that doesn't need upgrading for 7 years (or even 2 years) than providing a framework and ecosystem that encourages developers to target software at it.</p>

<p>If someone takes up the noble cause of trying to get your software included upstream, I would go so far as to make it plainly clear on whatever communication you have that you simply cannot support an unofficial repackaging of your software. Be polite. These are still your potential userbase. Simply state that those were not created by you and that the official packages are here.</p>

<h1>A case in point</h1>

<p>What I'm suggesting you do is not unheard of and honestly is the most tenable long term path for your users. Look at projects like Vagrant, Chef and Puppet among others. All of these tools are "owning their availability" the right way and are arguably providing better end user experiences than getting included in upstream could provide. In fact the experience of official packaging is above and beyond trying to do it yourself. As it should be.</p>
