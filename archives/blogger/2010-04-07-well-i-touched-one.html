<div class="entry-content">Yep. I just got an opportunity to play around with an iPad for about 10 minutes here at the office. (thanks @jpg)<div><br /></div><div>One thing that several people were saying around the office is:</div><div><br /></div><div><blockquote>I&#8217;m surprised by how fast it is</blockquote></div><div><br /></div><div>That confused me. I would expect any tech product I buy to be &#8220;fast&#8221;. I expect my laptop not to be slow. I expect my phone to be reasonably fast. Why would I <b>NOT</b> expect an iPad to be fast? I don&#8217;t intentionally buy slow tech. Anyway, as someone who has never used an iPhone it was interesting to say the least.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">It&#8217;s heavy</span></div><div>Some of that can be chalked up to the case that Jason had on it but honestly, I really could NOT see myself using this for long periods of time. When I sit down to read, I read. It&#8217;s not uncommon that Michelle and I would read for hours on end in bed. With her being pregnant, her Kindle has been awesome. She loves it. You could read a Kindle for 5 hours straight and not get tired holding it, nor would your eyes get strained. I can&#8217;t say that about an iPad (not that I&#8217;ve tried to read on it for 5 hours). Yes the &#8220;pages&#8221; of the book are beautiful but it will still be a strain on me.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Yes, it&#8217;s fast. </span></div><div>I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;surprised&#8221; how fast it was until I opened Google Maps. It was really snappy. Maybe it&#8217;s doing some insane caching locally. I have no idea but it was really nice. Safari was really fast as well.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">I don&#8217;t really like the iPhone &#8220;desktop&#8221;</span></div><div>Coming from my Droid, I really dislike having all those icons on the screen. It&#8217;s cluttered and hard to find applications.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The Kindle app is really nice</span></div><div>This would be a possible selling point for me. I&#8217;m going to do a little research about how it integrates with an existing Kindle.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Netflix is slick</span></div><div>Enough said. This would be great for taking all the kid&#8217;s shows that Gus likes to watch on the road.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">I was wrong about exporting (partially)</span></div><div>You <b>CAN</b> export directly from Pages (I didn&#8217;t give Numbers a go). It can export as Pages, PDF or Word (no clue on version).</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">UI transitions are slick and confusing.</span></div><div>Even Jason, who is pretty much integrated in the Apple ecosystem got confused for a minute. When Pages is in landscape mode, there&#8217;s no UI other than a blank page and the keyboard. When you go to portrait mode, it puts the menu bar up top. This is pretty confusing and honestly, annoying. I would never want to type on the smaller portrait keyboard. That means to do certain operations, I have to swap from landscape to portrait. Several applications behave differently between portrait and landscape. Some of them worked &#8220;intuitively&#8221; like Mail and some didn&#8217;t like Pages.</div><div><br /></div><div>So did I like it? Yes, for the most part. I really would have liked to give the Elements application a shot. THAT is something of a killer app for me. I&#8217;m big on educational software right now because of Gus (and as of tomorrow, Nat). In fact, I&#8217;m really considering hitting the Apple Store on the way home to buy one but I probably won&#8217;t.</div><div><br /></div><div>Why?</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">No sideloading of content.</span></div><div>This is a BIG problem for me. I hate iTunes with a passion. Ignore for a moment that we keep ALL of our media on a server at home, the only reason I have a Windows machine is for gaming. My main desktop is a Linux machine as is my netbook. My wife has her laptop but it&#8217;s hers. I&#8217;ve taken great pains to keep that gaming machine as optimized as possible. iTunes is a pain in the ass. </div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Limited format support/Lock-in</span></div><div>Okay so I could load MP3s on it but I would just rather use my Droid. So that&#8217;s not an issue. What is an issue is videos. All of our tv shows are converted from the MythTV backend to MKV format and archived. Obviously the iPad doesn&#8217;t support MKV only MP4. There won&#8217;t be any loss in quality but what there will be is the pain in the ass of re-encoding everything to MP4. To be fair, I would only export a few shows ahead of time so it could be handled then.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">App Store/iTunes Store</span></div><div>This is kind of a deal breaker. Let&#8217;s assume for a moment that I go whole hog and start buying the kid&#8217;s shows via iTunes. For those of you without toddlers, let me clarify something - they are obsessive. To a scary fault. When Gus gets it in his head that he wants to watch Thomas or Dinosaur Train or Elmo, that is ALL he wants to watch. So now I&#8217;ve got all these shows I bought from iTunes that he likes. The ONLY place he can watch them is on the iPad. I can&#8217;t export them to my server and play them on my TV unless I buy an Apple TV.</div><div><br /></div><div>Let me describe our video usage pattern at home. We record PBS shows via MythTV. We stream Netflix with the XBOX 360. Streaming is nice but isn&#8217;t an &#8220;anywhere/anytime&#8221; option. So assuming I&#8217;ve bought shows via iTunes, I can&#8217;t watch them anywhere with my current setup except the iPad or the Windows machine where I&#8217;ve grudgingly installed iTunes. I can&#8217;t hook the iPad up to the TV and I can&#8217;t export it so that I can.</div><div><br /></div><div>So that removes the value of the iPad as a video mechanism unless I want to buy multiple copies of various content just so I can use it elsewhere.</div><div><br /></div><div>So that relegates it to an eBook reader. This has promise but as I&#8217;ve said earlier, it&#8217;s way too heavy for long term usage. The interactive benefits don&#8217;t outweigh that for me.</div><div><br /></div><div>So what am I left with? It&#8217;s not a very multiple user friendly device. It doesn&#8217;t support multiple accounts so I can&#8217;t have both my social networking profile and my wife&#8217;s on it. It&#8217;s mine or her&#8217;s not a shared resource. It&#8217;s too expensive as just an eBook reader.</div><div><br /></div><div>It&#8217;s not very portable. Yes, it&#8217;s more portable than a laptop but it&#8217;s also much more limited in use. Streaming Netflix is nice but I&#8217;m not always in range of an AP. It doesn&#8217;t have a GPS so using it as a physical map replacement is a no go. </div><div><br /></div><div>I could wait for the 3G version but 3G is on the way out and I <b>ALREADY</b> have a data plan with Verizon for my Droid. Why would I <b>ALSO</b> pay money to AT&amp;T? Sure we pay that cost with our Kindle but it&#8217;s part of the purchase price.</div><div><br /></div><div>So where does it really fit in? Educational use? Absolutely. As I said, something like the Elements application would be awesome for the kids but honestly, I don&#8217;t feel comfortable giving it to my toddler to play with like I would a $50 LeapFrog toy. If he were older, yes but he&#8217;s coordination isn&#8217;t there yet.</div><div><br /></div><div>So will I buy one? Nope. Not right now. I want to see what comes out in the same space with Android running on it. I want to get a device that has a longer lifespan. I also want something more open. I want to get something that I can EASILY move content to and from without any external requirements. I can pair my Droid with any bluetooth device in my house and export the songs I bought from Amazon. I don&#8217;t have to fire up some application like iTunes to do it. I don&#8217;t want to get locked in to having to be wrapped from head to toe in Apple gear just to get the flexibility I desire.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/934985301455705990-7895157696165553409?l=lusislog.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
